# Svelte-Contacts

This is a learning project for Svelte. It is a simple contact list that allows you to add and delete contacts. It uses a local storage to store the contacts.

## Running it on your machine

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The project is deployed on vercel. You can see it live [here](https://svelte-contacts.vercel.app/).
